# DBD-Stats-Tracker

This project is a really tiny ionic App meant to keep track of your DBD atats

## Development server

Run `ionic serve` for a dev server. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ionic generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ionic generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module|page`.

## Build

Run `ionic build --aot` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `www/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Contributing
Since this is a tiny project we don't have strict rules about contributions. Just open a Pull Request to fix any of the project issues or any improvement you have percieved on your own. Any contributions which improve or fix the project will be accepted as long as they don't deviate too much from the project objectives. If you have doubts about whether the PR would be accepted or not you can open an issue before coding to ask for my opinion
